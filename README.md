# NOTE: This software is no longer maintained.
I'm sorry for any users, but I simply did not have the continued time & interest in maintaining this Atom package and keeping it running on newer versions of Atom. If you're interested, please continue where I left off. 

As an alternative, you might want to check out this package: [script](https://atom.io/packages/script)

# Run, Code, Run!

## Usage
Press Cmd+Ctrl+R on any open editor to run the currently open tab's content via node.js' `exec`.
Output will be displayed in a new pane. STDERR and execution errors will appear in red. Make sure to include a [shebang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) so your shell knows how to run the file.

## Notes
Run, Code, Run! will check your file's permissions to see if it's executable by you. If it isn't, it will make the file executable for you.
